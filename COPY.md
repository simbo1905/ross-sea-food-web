This diagram shows how the food web in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, works. The arrows represent the energy flow and go from prey species (these get eaten) to predators (the hunters).

Notes: Baleen whales use baleen plates in their mouths to sieve plankton, krill and small fish from the water. Toothed whales have teeth for capturing prey. Krill is the dominant zooplankton species in the Ross Sea.
