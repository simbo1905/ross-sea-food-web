      "choices": ["Fish", "Krill", "Seals", "Whales"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Krill form enormous swarms and represent the largest biomass in Antarctic waters. A single swarm can contain millions of individuals and stretch for kilometers!",

      "choices": ["Krill", "Phytoplankton", "Giant squid", "Small fish"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sperm whales and other toothed whales dive deep to hunt giant squid. Some battles between sperm whales and giant squid leave scars on the whale's skin!",

      "choices": ["They eat other organisms", "They produce their own food from sunlight", "They produce oxygen only", "They reproduce quickly"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Phytoplankton are primary producers because they convert sunlight into food through photosynthesis, forming the base of the ocean food web.",

      "choices": ["They hunt larger prey", "They filter small organisms from water", "They eat only plants", "They feed at night"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Baleen whales have comb-like plates that filter huge amounts of water to catch tiny organisms like krill, while toothed whales hunt individual larger prey.",

      "image2": "BD.png",
      "choices": ["Primary producers", "Top predators", "Decomposers", "Primary consumers"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Bacteria are decomposers that break down dead organisms and waste, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem for primary producers to use.",

      "image1": "FB.png",
      "image2": "FB.png",
      "choices": ["Seals", "Skua birds", "Whales", "Fish"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skuas are aggressive seabirds that prey on penguin eggs and chicks. They're opportunistic feeders and play an important role in the Antarctic ecosystem.",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": "med_7",
      "question": "Why is overfishing of toothfish a concern for the Ross Sea ecosystem?",
      "image1": "TF.png",
      "image2": "FH.png",
      "choices": ["They eat too much krill", "They're primary producers", "They're top predators that control fish populations", "They produce oxygen"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Toothfish are apex predators. Removing too many disrupts the balance by allowing their prey species to multiply unchecked, affecting the entire food web.",

      "difficulty": "medium"

      "question": "What connects all organisms in this Antarctic food web?",
      "image1": "KR.png",
      "image2": "KR.png",
      "choices": ["Temperature", "Krill as a key food source", "Ocean depth", "Migration patterns"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Krill are the keystone species connecting primary producers to higher predators. Most Antarctic animals either eat krill directly or eat animals that feed on krill.",

      "difficulty": "medium"

      "choices": ["Live fish", "Sunlight", "Marine snow (dead organic matter)", "Large whales"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Benthic invertebrates feed on 'marine snow' - dead plankton, feces, and other organic matter that slowly sinks to the ocean floor from the waters above.",

      "choices": ["Penguins", "Krill", "Elephant seals", "Silverfish"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Elephant seals can dive over 2,000 meters deep and hold their breath for up to 2 hours while hunting for deep-sea fish and squid!",

      "image1": "PP.png",
      "image2": "PP.png",
      "choices": ["They increase", "They decrease due to less sunlight", "They stay the same", "They move deeper"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Phytoplankton populations crash in winter when there's no sunlight for photosynthesis during the polar night, affecting the entire food web.",

      "image1": "SE.png",
      "image2": "PG.png",
      "choices": ["None - they're herbivores", "1-2 penguins", "5-6 penguins", "10+ penguins"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Leopard seals are fierce predators that typically catch 1-2 penguins per day. They wait near ice edges where penguins enter and exit the water.",
