      "question": "Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) exhibit which unique behavior that affects nutrient distribution?",
      "image1": "KR.png",
      "image2": "KR.png",
      "choices": ["Diel vertical migration", "Horizontal spawning", "Benthic feeding", "Surface photosynthesis"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Krill perform diel vertical migration, moving to surface waters at night to feed and descending during the day. This behavior transports nutrients between ocean layers and affects the entire ecosystem's nutrient cycling.",

      "image2": "PP.png",
      "choices": ["5-10%", "10-15%", "15-20%", "20-25%"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Southern Ocean accounts for 15-20% of global marine primary production despite covering only 10% of ocean area. This high productivity supports the rich Antarctic food webs.",

      "choices": ["Enlarged lungs", "High myoglobin in muscles", "Faster heartbeat", "Thicker blubber"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Weddell seals have extremely high myoglobin concentrations in their muscles, allowing them to store oxygen for extended dives. They also slow their heart rate and redirect blood flow to vital organs.",

      "choices": ["-0.5°C", "-1.0°C", "-1.9°C", "-2.5°C"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Antarctic toothfish antifreeze glycoproteins prevent ice crystal formation in their blood at -1.9°C, the freezing point of seawater. This allows them to survive in the coldest marine environment on Earth.",

      "choices": ["Nitrogen fixation", "DOM recycling by bacteria", "Sulfur oxidation", "Methane production"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The microbial loop involves bacteria consuming dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by phytoplankton and other organisms, making nutrients available to protozoans and eventually back to larger organisms.",

      "choices": ["20-30%", "40-50%", "60-70%", "80-90%"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Antarctic silverfish make up 60-70% of Adélie penguin diet by mass in the Ross Sea, highlighting their critical role as a mid-trophic level species linking zooplankton to top predators.",

      "choices": ["100-200m", "200-500m", "500-1000m", "1000-2000m"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Benthic-pelagic coupling is strongest at 200-500m depths where continental shelf productivity creates high deposition rates of organic matter, supporting rich benthic communities.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Ross Sea polynya has exceptional primary productivity at ~200 g C/m²/yr, making it one of the most productive areas in the Southern Ocean due to extended ice-free conditions and nutrient upwelling.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Krill eggs sink at 100-150 m/day, descending to 700-1000m before hatching. The nauplii then swim upward over several weeks, a strategy that may reduce predation during vulnerable early stages.",
